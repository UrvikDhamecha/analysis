# Aave V2 Wallet Credit Score Analysis

This document presents an analysis of the credit scores assigned to wallets based on their Aave V2 transaction behavior, generated by the `score_wallets.py` script.

## 1. Score Distribution Graph

The following histogram illustrates the distribution of credit scores across all processed wallets:

**Observations on Distribution:**
* The scores generally appear to be centered around the middle ranges (e.g., 300-700), indicating that a significant portion of the wallets exhibit moderate behavior, neither extremely risky nor perfectly reliable within this dataset.
* **A notable observation from the current dataset and scoring logic is the absence of wallets in the extreme lowest (0-100) or highest (900-1000) score ranges.** This suggests that:
    * The sample dataset might not contain examples of truly "exploitative" or "bot-like" behavior that would trigger very low scores, nor does it contain "perfect", long-term, highly reliable users that would achieve the maximum score.
    * Alternatively, the current weighting of features in the rule-based scoring might be too conservative to push scores to the extremes, or the normalization method applied. Further tuning of the scoring rules or a larger, more diverse dataset might reveal more distinct extreme behaviors.

## 2. Behavior of Wallets in the Lower Score Ranges

Wallets in the lower score ranges (e.g., 0-300) are typically characterized by behaviors that indicate higher risk or less responsible protocol usage.

**Key Characteristics of Low-Scoring Wallets (as per scoring logic):**
* **Liquidations**: Wallets that have been subjected to `liquidationcall` actions (i.e., got liquidated) receive significant deductions, placing them firmly in the lower score brackets. This is a primary indicator of inability to manage collateral or debt effectively.
* **Low Repayment Ratios**: Wallets with very low or zero `repay_to_borrow_ratio` (meaning they borrowed but repaid little to nothing) are heavily penalized. These could represent dormant debts or attempts to "borrow and abandon".
* **High Net Borrow**: Wallets with significant `net_borrow_usd` and no corresponding repayments suggest outstanding debt that contributes to a lower score.
* **Short or Infrequent Activity**: New wallets or those with very few transactions and minimal engagement might also receive lower scores if they primarily engage in borrowing without establishing a history of responsible interaction.

**Example Behavior (Hypothetical, based on expected feature values):**
A wallet that borrowed a substantial amount but then made no repayments, or worse, was liquidated, would likely fall into this category. Such a wallet might show a high `total_borrow_usd`, `has_outstanding_debt=1`, and `num_liquidated_as_user=1`.

## 3. Behavior of Wallets in the Higher Score Ranges

Wallets in the higher score ranges (e.g., 700-1000, although in this sample, max scores are around 800s) exhibit characteristics of reliable and responsible usage within the Aave V2 protocol.

**Key Characteristics of High-Scoring Wallets (as per scoring logic):**
* **High Repayment Ratios**: Wallets with a `repay_to_borrow_ratio` close to 1 (or even greater than 1 if they over-repaid) are strongly rewarded. This signifies diligent debt management.
* **Positive Net Deposits**: Wallets that have significantly more deposits than redemptions (`net_deposit_usd` is high and positive) indicate a strong commitment to providing liquidity or using the protocol for yield generation.
* **Consistent Activity & Engagement**: Wallets with a high `total_transactions` count and a long `duration_of_activity_days` demonstrate sustained interaction and familiarity with the protocol.
* **Diverse Actions**: Wallets performing a variety of actions (`unique_actions`) beyond just basic deposits or borrows (e.g., also managing collateral, initiating liquidations, etc. if interpreted positively) show a more comprehensive and active participation.
* **No Liquidations**: Crucially, high-scoring wallets are unlikely to have any `num_liquidated_as_user` events, indicating effective risk management and collateralization.

**Example Behavior (Hypothetical, based on expected feature values):**
A wallet that frequently deposits, borrows responsibly, and consistently repays their loans, maintains a healthy collateralization ratio, and engages with the protocol over an extended period would receive a high score. Such a wallet might have a high `total_deposit_usd`, `repay_to_borrow_ratio` near 1, and `duration_of_activity_days` spanning many months.

## 4. Insights and Observations

* The current scoring model effectively captures fundamental risk and reliability signals present in DeFi lending protocols.
* The small sample size likely limits the diversity of extreme behaviors observed, leading to a narrower score distribution than might be seen with the full 100K transaction dataset.
* The "liquidationcall" action, especially when a wallet is the target, serves as a powerful negative indicator, demonstrating the immediate financial consequence of irresponsible borrowing.
* Repayment behavior (captured by `repay_to_borrow_ratio`) is a cornerstone of responsible usage and heavily influences positive scores.
* Future work could involve gathering labeled data to train a supervised machine learning model, which might uncover more nuanced patterns and improve predictive accuracy beyond a rule-based system. Additionally, incorporating more complex time-series features or network analysis (e.g., wallet connections) could enhance the model's capabilities.
